# Research Proposal: Cognitive and Neuroimaging Data Analysis

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions for running the data analysis of cognitive assessments and neuroimaging data. The analysis focuses on understanding hippocampal subfield activity in relation to cognitive functions such as spatial memory and episodic memory recall, utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict cognitive outcomes based on hippocampal structure and activity.
