# Research Proposal: Cognitive and Neuroimaging Data Analysis

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions for running the data analysis of cognitive assessments and neuroimaging data. The analysis focuses on understanding hippocampal subfield activity in relation to cognitive functions such as spatial memory and episodic memory recall, utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict cognitive outcomes based on hippocampal structure and activity.

## Prerequisites

Before running the analysis, ensure that the following software and libraries are installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Anaconda (recommended for managing dependencies)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for running notebooks)
- Required Python Libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - scipy
  - nibabel
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - fslpy (for neuroimaging data preprocessing)
  - nibabel (for MRI data handling)
  - PyTorch or TensorFlow (for machine learning models)

## Installation Instructions

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-proposal.git

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda create --name research-env python=3.7
   conda activate research-env
   
3. **Install Required Libraries**

   Install all necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Set Up Neuroimaging Tools**

   Ensure that you have neuroimaging tools such as FSL installed for data preprocessing:
   Follow the installation instructions for FSL: FSL Installation Guide

5. **Download the Dataset**

   Make sure to download the necessary dataset for analysis. Ensure it is structured as per the projectâ€™s directory structure (cognitive data,
   neuroimaging data, etc.).

### Cloud Setup

1. **Cloud Platform Setup**

   For cloud environments (e.g., Google Colab, AWS, Azure), the steps for setup are as follows:
   Google Colab:
   Open a new Colab notebook.
   Use the following to mount Google Drive and access the repository:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

   Clone the repository directly within the Colab notebook:
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-proposal.git
   ```
   
   AWS or Azure:
   Launch an EC2 or Azure VM instance with a suitable machine configuration.
   SSH into the instance and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-proposal.git

2. **Install Dependencies**

   On cloud environments, install the required dependencies similarly to the local setup. For example:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Upload and Configure Dataset**
   Upload the dataset to the cloud storage or directly into the environment. Ensure the directory structure matches the local setup for consistency in
   data processing.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The dataset consists of cognitive data (spatial navigation, autobiographical memory recall, word-pair recall) and neuroimaging data (structural MRI, fMRI, diffusion-weighted MRI). Preprocessing involves several steps:

Normalization and standardization of cognitive performance scores.
Neuroimaging preprocessing using tools like FSL, including skull stripping, motion correction, coregistration, and normalization to standard space.
Hippocampal subfield segmentation and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analysis to analyze the gray matter volume of hippocampal subfields.

## Running the Analysis
### Local Environment
1. After setting up the environment as described above, navigate to the directory containing the analysis scripts.
2. Run the preprocessing and analysis scripts sequentially:
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   python analyze_data.py
   python train_models.py
   ```
3. Results will be stored in the output/ directory.

### Cloud Environment
1. In a cloud environment, upload the dataset and set up the necessary folders for output.

2. Run the analysis in the cloud environment using the respective commands:
   ```python
   !python preprocessing.py
   !python analyze_data.py
   !python train_models.py
   ```
3. The output will be saved in the configured cloud storage or output directories.

## Model Evaluation and Output
After running the analysis, the models will be evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks. For regression tasks, the evaluation will include Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

The results will be stored in the output/ directory and include:

Model performance metrics
Predictions and visualizations
Statistical analysis of the results
