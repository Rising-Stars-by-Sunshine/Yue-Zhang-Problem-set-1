We share data from N=217 healthy adults (mean age 29 years, range 20-41; 109 females, 108 males) who underwent extensive cognitive assessment and neuroimaging to examine the neural basis of individual differences, with a particular focus on a brain structure called the hippocampus.
Cognitive data were collected using a wide array of questionnaires, naturalistic tasks including autobiographical memory recall, imagination and spatial navigation, traditional laboratory-based tasks such as recalling word pairs, and comprehensive characterisation of the strategies used to perform the cognitive tests.
3 Tesla MRI data were also acquired and include multi-parameter mapping to examine tissue microstructure, diffusion-weighted MRI, T2-weighted high-resolution partial volume structural MRI scans (with the masks of hippocampal subfields manually segmented from these scans), whole brain resting state functional MRI scans and partial volume high resolution resting state functional MRI scans.

## Description of the data and file structure

The data and file structure are described in detail in Clark, I.A. & Maguire, E. A. (2023). Release of cognitive and multimodal MRI data including real-world tasks and hippocampal subfield segmentations. Scientific Data. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02449-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02449-9)

Behavioural data are available as Microsoft Excel files.
Full_Results.xlxs contains the sample demographics, summary questionnaire data, summary real-world test data, laboratory-based memory test data and laboratory-based general cognitive test data.
Questionnaires_Item_by_Item.xlsx contains item-by-item level data (i.e. the response to each question for each questionnaire) for the questionnaires.
Real_World_Tasks_Individual_Trials.xlsx contains trial level data for the Scene Construction Test, the Autobiographical Interview and the Future Thinking Test.
Strategies.xlsx contains the strategy data for each test for which strategy data were obtained.

To note:
In general, a lower score on the variables on the Questionnaires sheet of Full_Results.xlxs (and also the Questionnaires_Item_by_Item.xlxs) suggests lower self-reported ability for that questionnaire topic. The exceptions are the One Sentence Questionnaire Ability questions and the reverse scored items labelled in the Questionnaires_Item_by_Item.xlxs, where lower scores reflect higher self-reported abilities. In addition, on the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale, lower scores reflect higher self-reported abilities, with the exception of the reverse scored items where lower scores reflect lower self-reported abilities.
In general, a lower score on the variables included on the Real-World Tests sheet of Full_Results.xlxs (Scene Construction Test, Autobiographical Interview, Future Thinking Test, Navigation) (and also the Real_World_Tests_Individual_Trials.xlxs) suggests a lower ability to imagine fictitious scenarios, recall autobiographical memories, think about the future and navigate in the real world respectively.
In general, a lower score on the variables included on the Laboratory Memory Tests sheet of Full_Results.xlxs suggests poorer memory ability when measured using standard laboratory-based memory tasks. The exception is the Trials to Criterion metric of the ObjectPlace Association Test where lower scores reflect greater ability.
In general, a lower score on the variables included on the Laboratory Cognitive Tests sheet suggests lower cognitive performance when measured using standard cognitive laboratory-based tasks. The exception is the Boundary Extension Test where a lower score is associated with greater boundary extension.

3T MRI data are available in zipped folders grouped by scan type, with each participant's scans for that scan type in individual folders. Raw MRI data have undergone DICOM conversion in the program Statistical Parametric Mapping and are provided as NifTI files (extension .nii).
The zip folders MPM_1 and MPM_2 contain the Multi-Parameter Mapping data. MPM_1 contains the data for participants 1 to 108 and MPM_2 contains the data for participants 109 to 217. Each participant has 6 folders. The MPM_B1_Map folder contains 22 images for B1 mapping. The MPM_Fieldmap_Magnitude folder and MPM_Fieldmap_Phase folder contain 2 images and 1 image respectively for B0 calibration. The MPM_T1_weighted folder contains the 8 T1 weighted images, the MPM_PD_weighted folder has the 8 PD weighted images and the MPM_MT_weighted folder the 6 MT weighted images.
The zip folder DWI contains the Diffusion Weighted Imaging data. Each participant has 4 folders, each containing 66 files. The folder DWI_AP_B1000 contains the images with B-values of 1000 collected in the anterior to posterior direction. The folder DWI_PA_B1000 contains the images with B-values of 1000 collected in the posterior to anterior direction. The DWI_AP_B2500 folder contains the images with B-values of 2500 collected in the anterior to posterior direction. The DWI_PA_B2500 folder contains the images with B-values of 2500 collected in the posterior to anterior direction.
The text files bvec.bvec and bval.bval contain the bvec and bval data for each volume.
The zip folder Hippocampal Subfield Segmentation contains the partial volume high resolution structural images and the manually segmented hippocampal subfield masks. Within the folder are three further folders. The Main Sample folder contains the 201 participants for whom hippocampal subfield segmentations could be performed. Each participant's folder contains defaced high resolution structural images (typically 3 image files), the denoised and averaged structural image used for hippocampal segmentation (e.g. anon_meansMXXXXXX-0008-00001-000001-01_denoised_prinlm_b2.0.nii) and the bilateral hippocampal subfield segmentation itself (Hippocampal_Segmentation.nii). The DICE folder contains the segmentations of the 20 participants used for inter-rater reliability; each participant's folder contains 5 image files - three defaced high resolution structural images, the denoised and averaged structural image used for hippocampal segmentation (e.g. anon_meansMXXXXXX-0008-00001-000001-01_denoised_prinlm_b2.0.nii) and the bilateral hippocampal subfield segmentation itself (Hippocampal_Segmentation.nii). The Low Quality Scans contains the data of the 16 participants whose high resolution structural scans (even after denoising and averaging) were deemed too poor for hippocampal subfield segmentation to be performed. For each participant we provide the defaced high resolution structural images (typically 3) and the defaced averaged and denoised structural image considered not suitable for subfield segmentation.Hippocampal_Subfield_Volumes.xlsx contains summary data for the hippocampal segmentations. Volume measurements are provided as millimeters cubed.
Hippocampal Subfield Segmentation Labels.txt, is the ITK snap label description file providing the label information for the hippocampal subfield segmentations when opened in ITK snap.
The zip folder FLASH Structural Session 1 contains the FLASH structural data collected in the first MRI session. Each participant's folder contains 2 image files.
The zip folder FLASH Structural Session 2 contains the FLASH structural data collected in the second MRI session. Each participant's folder contains 2 image files.
The zip folder Whole Brain Resting State contains the whole brain resting state data. Each participant has three folders. The Whole_Brain_Resting_State folder contains the 220 EPI images. The WB_Fieldmap_Magnitude folder and WB_Fieldmap_Phase folder contain 2 images and 1 image respectively for the B0 field map.
The zip folder Partial Vol Hi Res Resting State contains the high resolution resting state data. Each participant has three folders. The Partial_Volume_Resting_State folder contains the 200 partial volume EPI images. The PV_Fieldmap_Magnitude folder and PV_Fieldmap_Phase folder contain 2 images and 1 image respectively for the B0 field map.
